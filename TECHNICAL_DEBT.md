## Introduction

_When do I add technical debt to this list?_

- If you **come across** code, that you want to **refactor** in the future
- If you **create** technical debt, that only requires **refactoring** to fix

_When do I create an issue on github instead?_

- If you **create** technical debt, because you had to implement the first solution

## Template
