# How do you communicate software quality?

CodeCharta is a tool that allows you to import and **combine** metrics from various sources like [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), Svn, Git or directly from your source code. It's not tied to a specific programming language and we provide several [importers]({% link _docs/05-02-importers.md %}) that you can use. After importing the sources you can then visualize your code metrics.
