**How do you communicate software quality?** CodeCharta is a tool that allows you to import and **combine** metrics from various sources like SonarQube, Svn, Git or directly from your source code. It's not tied to a specific programming language and we provide several [importers]({% link _docs/05-03-importers.md %}) that you can use to gain metrics. CodeCharta then allows you to [visualize]({% link _docs/06-01-visualization.md %}) these metrics and make the quality of your code base tangible which you can use to gain insights and **communicate with your stakeholders**.
